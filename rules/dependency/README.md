## One of top important module!

As for me ofk))

This is a killer-feature and the rules which would help you soooo much in maintaining the dependencies

Module contains 2 submodules

- bump
- substitute


## Bump

The rule that check that specified library is at least \<yourSpecifiedVersion> or higher

And if not - helps the programmer to up the version


## Substitute


The rule that check that specified library exists. And if yes - suggest you to delete it, and install new specified one instead

Similar to bump - it is a very verbose, so change the library would easy as newer before
